            <h1>How a Hacker finds a Webpage</h1>
        </center>
        <li><em><strong>The hacker </strong></em> will first look for websites where the user would input information.
            Let’s
            say the hacker finds a bank website and types in something like: “eiurh7db” into the login and a response
            comes
            back as login failed, the hacker then knows that this website is vulnerable to cross site scripting.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The hacker then inspects/test the page to see if it is possible to insert JavaScript and HTML into the
            page- which is done by entering some script into the username. This then affects the output and if it is
            vulnerable, a message will pop up saying “XSS.”</li>
        <br>
        <li> The hacker will then create a URL used to steal the users information.</li>
        <br>
        <li>They then will inspect the HTML of the web page to adjust the URL. Now if you then enter your information
            to the login, the hacker will then steal the information along with your password</li>
        <br>
        <li>The attacker will go into the document and insert a "form" tag to end/stop the original code.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The hacker will then add in additional properties to the document, which is set in JavaScript.This is
            called onsubmit property. The first the of the URL has a new object, an image. </li>
        <br>
        <li>The second part of the URL contains “password,” and “login” boxes. When the user types in their
            information, it will all be sent to the hacker. </li>
        <br>
        <li>After this, the hacker will then put into a URL. This has the arguments contained for the login and the
            parameter last.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Lastly, all the hacker has to do is to get someone to fall victim to their plan. </li>


        <center>
            <h1>How XSS works</h1>
        </center>
        <li><em><strong>The hacker</strong></em> will go into a web page and that has the vulnerability of cross
            site
            scripting
            being implemented
            into
            the
            web site.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The hacker will inspect/analyze the HTML used of the web site.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Next, the hacker will
            cut
            and
            paste
            the HTML into a text file, save it then open it in a web browser. HTTP is one of the reasons why
            cross
            site
            scripting is so successful- it accepts the request the hacker and builds a web page with the script
            embedded by
            the
            hacker.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When the user enters their information, it is then stored on a web server. Once you click
            on
            the
            hyperlink
            in which the hacker has created an embedded the cross site scripting on all of your information
            directly
            goes
            to
            the hacker.</li>
