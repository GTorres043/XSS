    <h1>Basics</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Cross site scripting is a hacking phenomenon disguised as links/online sources used to steal people’s
            information.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            A type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web application.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts
            into web pages viewed by other users.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>84% of all security vulnerabilities have been documented.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When you get an email to win a new Iphone or a web page titled “extremely cheap car for sale.”
            Anything to grab the attention of the user to get them to check out their page. In turn, your information
            is
            the sent to the hacker once you click on the hyperlink.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The attacker will place a signature in Javascript code. Then, a tiny dot the size of zero is placed on the
            web page, it can not be spotted due to the size. The browser will then request permission to use cookie
            which then takes your information if the attacker feels the need.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The victim's browser parses and HTML code which triggers an HTTP request to the server of the attacker. It
            includes cookies from which the attacker can extract and use it to inpersonate the victim and also launch
            further attacks.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Current Event 2018</h2>
    <p>
        The most current event of cross site scripting happened in Britain. British Airways to be in fact between
        August 21st, to September 5th . The “breach” is most likely linked to a hacker group that goes by the name
        “Magecart.” What exactly did they breach? It was many people’s credit card information, and they did this by
        using the “card skimming.” The group obtained information through people who payed through websites and apps.
        The group also did the same thing to the website Ticketmaster. Around 380,000 people’s have had information
        stolen from them due to this event. To fix this, British Airways had to go through detection hits and by going
        through scripts individually on the website. After this, they have to go in and fix the code along with
        breaking the hack code.
